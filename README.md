This file contains code for the pricing of call options on zero coupon bonds and for pricing caplets. The zero coupon bond curve is modelled by a simple exponential function. The model for the short rate is the one factor Hull-White model. Caplets are priced under the T-forward measure for which there is an analytical solution.
